Packages
Every Go program is made up of packages.

Let's onsider this code:

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}


Programs start running in package main.
This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. 
For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

import "fmt"
import "math"
But it is good style to use the factored import statement.
